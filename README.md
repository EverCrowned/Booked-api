## Hey! The file structure reminds me of King Typer!

You're absolutely right. The file structure is from King Typer, however, most of the code from there has been erased over the span of like 10 commits. The only things that remain are the file structure, boilerplate files (think index.ts or apiRouter.ts) and some middleware functions like CORS and schema validation. Everything else has been deleted or changed.
